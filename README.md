# masters-

This repository contains some of my notebooks from my master's degree project. The main goal was to built a model capable of predicting chronic diseases (type 2 diabetes, hypertesion and dyslipidemia) using only lifestyle variables.

I'll be feeding the repository in time.

Welcome and best regards.
